# restaurant-page

## 5th project from TOP full stack JS path

Starting with ES6 Modules and Webpack in the Javascript course, I thought, wow, all this is getting a little too complicated for me - how am I ever going to keep this all in my mind?

Anyway I set about creating this restaurant page and I really enjoyed it - and in fact it's enough just to know what the options are, where to get information about them and how to use them.

Maybe I was a bit too lazy, and maybe it's not the best choice to use 'innerHTML' to display the retrieved pages, but it's good enough in this case, I think.

I had a few little design gimmicks in mind and I'm happy I managed to implement them easily. It's a good feeling to know how to get these running.

Maybe I should just slow down a little, after all, it's not even been a full three months since I started 'The Odin Project'...
