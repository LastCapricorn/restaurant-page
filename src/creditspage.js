      <h3>Here are a few good addresses in this city, which also supported us as
        partners:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take a look at this
        <a href='https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077'>ultimate city guide</a>
          if you want to find out how to become a legend in Night City, i.e. die the
          right way.</li>
        <li>If you ever need an alibi or want to brag to your buddies and want to
          substantiate the whole thing with "proof photos", you should drop by the
          <a href='https://creator.nightcafe.studio/'>Nightcafe</a>. You just have to
          find the right words...</li>
        <li>You want to open a shop in this town? Then go to
          <a href='https://www.designevo.com/'>DesignEvo</a> - because you absolutely
          need a logo!</li>
        <li>You've probably already seen these hieroglyphic writings all over the city -
          it's the official font of Night City, but frankly no one is able to read it.
          That's why we chose something more appealing and readable and found it on
          1001FreeFonts:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><a href='https://www.1001freefonts.com/cheveux-dange.font'>
              Cheveux d'ange</a></li>
            <li><a href='https://www.1001freefonts.com/c7nazara.font'>C7nazara</a></li>
          </ul>
        <li>By the way, none of this is true and this website only exists because of
          <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page'>
          The Odin Project</a> and my passion for web development and design. Maybe I'm
          on the right track...</li>
