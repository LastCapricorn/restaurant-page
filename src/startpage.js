      <h2>This is the damn hottest burger joint in all of Night City and beyond!</h2>
      <h3>~ We are there for you 24/7 ~</h3>
      <p>We only use the finest ingredients legally available in our burgers, so don't
        believe any rumours:
        We never process any meat stuff from Pacifica!</p>
      <p>Our food printers work with BioTechnica synthetic flours only and we are the
        first and so far the only ones to use the FaVIcon 3.2 (Fruit and Vegetable Ionic
        Converter).</p>
      <p>Due to our special house blend of seaweed and synth corn flour, our burger buns
        are less green than others.</p>
      <p>Of course, we also deliver our food directly to you, wherever you are - even in
        the last corners of the badlands. For this we use retired and converted Militech
        Griffin drones.</p>
      <p>Each burger comes packaged in an autonomous microwave box.</p>
      <p>Warning: Microwave boxes do not belong in the hands of children.</p>
      <p>Warning: We are legally obliged to point out that autonomous microwave boxes may
        not be used as weapons!</p>
        <p>So take a look at our menu and join us in Watson.</p>
        <p>1 desire + 3 dimensions === 4d burger press:</p>
        <p>we print your patty!</p>
